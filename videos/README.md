# primate-like-decisions/videos

In this folder are videos showing stimuli and single trials from an example trained arm agent.



### Files starting with "rdk_" contain example videos of the random dot motion stimulus.

All videos are for dots moving to the right at different dot coherence levels:

``rdk_100right.mp4``: Rightward dot motion with 100% coherence.

``rdk_51right.mp4``: Rightward dot motion with 51.2% coherence.

``rdk_26right.mp4``: Rightward dot motion with 25.6% coherence.

``rdk_13right.mp4``: Rightward dot motion with 12.8% coherence.

``rdk_6right.mp4``: Rightward dot motion with 6.4% coherence.

``rdk_3right.mp4``: Rightward dot motion with 3.2% coherence.

and

``rdk_100right_interval1.mp4``: Rightward dot motion with 100% coherence, and 1 interleaved frame (used exclusively during training).

``rdk_100right_interval3.mp4``: Rightward dot motion with 100% coherence, and 3 interleaved frames (used during training, and for evaluation).



### Files starting with "arm_" contain videos of an example trained arm agent on single trials.

``arm_100left.mp4``: Example trial of an arm agent making a decision when the stimulus contained leftward dot motion with 100% coherence.

``arm_100right.mp4``: Example trial of an arm agent making a decision when the stimulus contained rightward dot motion with 100% coherence.

``arm_2right_center.mp4``: Example trial of an arm agent making a decision when the stimulus contained rightward dot motion with 1.6% coherence.
On this trial, the agent reached up the center, in contrast to easier trials (e.g., 100% coherence), where the agent reaches more directly toward each respective target.

``arm_2right_com1.mp4``: Example trial of an arm agent making a decision when the stimulus contained rightward dot motion with 1.6% coherence.
On this trial, the agent made a stereotypical corrective change of mind, initially reaching toward the left (incorrect) target before ultimately selecting the right (correct) target.

``arm_2right_com2.mp4``: Example trial of an arm agent making a decision when the stimulus contained rightward dot motion with 1.6% coherence.
On this trial, the agent also made a corrective change of mind, but hesitated just before it would have selected the incorrect choice. This behavior is similar to human data we collected.
